node-boilerplate
================

A framework of default libraries for starting a project.

# Current state

Added express, jade templates, gulp, bootstrap, and redis.

### Note

The logs directory isn't tracked so you'll need to cd into node-boilerplate and

    mkdir logs
    cd logs
    vim server.log
    :wq

Testing configuration
